# Professional_README_Generator

![Github license](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

- The reason for creating this readme generator was to help me manage my time for future projects. Instead of creating each readme from scrap I can now use the integrated terminal to access the command prompts and simply answer the proceeding questions to fill out my readme. This now solves the issue of structuring a professional readme and I can now use the time I save to complete other tasks
